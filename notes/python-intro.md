## What Can Python Do?
Python can:
- Create server-side web applications
- Be used alongside software to automate workflows
- Connect to databases + read & modify files
- Handle big data + perform complex mathematics
- Be used for rapid prototyping or production-ready software

---

## Why Python?
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.
- Simple syntax similar to English
- Shorter code than many languages
- Interpreter so it runs code immediately (fast to test ideas)
- Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming

---

## Python Syntax vs Other Languages
- Designed for readability, influenced by mathematics
- Uses **new lines** instead of semicolons
- Uses **indentation (whitespace)** instead of curly brackets '{ }'
  to define the scope of loops, functions, classes, etc.

print("Hello, World!")
