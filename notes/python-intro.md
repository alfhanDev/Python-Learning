What is Python? 

- Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum.
- Used for web development (server side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.

What Can Python do?

Python can:
  - Be used on a server to create web applications.
  - Be used alongside software to create workflows.
  - Connect to database systems. It can aslo read and modify files.
  - Be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
  - Be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python?

- Works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way of a functional way.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages:
  - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English langauge with influence from mathematics.
  - Uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
  - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

  Example:

  print("Hello, World!")
