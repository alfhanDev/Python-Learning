# Python Syntax

## Execute Python syntax
Python syntax can be executed directly from the command line.

## Python Indentation
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
- Where in other programming languages the indentation in a code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

### Example:

    if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")

### Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation

#### Example  
Syntax Error:

    if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")

### The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

#### Example:

    if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 

    if 5 > 2:
                print("Five is greater than two!")

## Python Variables
- In python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.

### Example:

    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World!"

---

## Comments
- Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
- Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.

### Example:

    # This is a comment.
    print("Hello, World!")
